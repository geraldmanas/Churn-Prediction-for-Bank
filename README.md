# Churn-Prediction-for-Bank

Customer churn is a loss of clients because of customers stopping doing business with a company. It is an important metric for businesses to track, as it can have significant financial implications. For example, acquiring new customers can be more expensive than retaining existing ones, so reducing churn can help a company save on marketing and sales costs.

In the context of banking, customer churn refers to customers leaving a bank and taking their business elsewhere. This can be a significant issue for banks, as acquiring new customers can be more expensive than retaining existing ones. Therefore, banks may implement strategies to reduce customer churn and retain valuable customers.

There are many factors that can contribute to customer churn in the banking industry, such as dissatisfaction with service, high fees or charges, or a lack of convenient or innovative services. Banks may also face competition from other financial institutions that offer more attractive products or services.
